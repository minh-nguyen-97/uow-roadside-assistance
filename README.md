## Detailed Description
A web application which provides roadside assistance services. These services provide assistance to motorists whose vehicles have suffered a mechanical failure (e.g.flat batteries, flat tyres, towing, locked out or emergency fuel delivery) that leaves the driver stranded on the road. Customers can choose either:
- Membership subscription – customers will pay a fixed membership fee annually and are entitled to
unlimited roadside assistance callouts. This is similar to NRMA services.
- Pay-on-demand – customers will pay per service use. When the need emerges (e.g. their car broke
down), they will request assistance through the system. Prices are calculated and presented to customers
up front. This is similar to Uber-style but for roadside assistance.  

Once a customer makes a service request, it will be broadcasted to all the registered professionals who are
available and capable to provide this service in nearby area. They will receive information about the
problematic vehicle (e.g. location, plate number, model, etc.), instructions and payment via the system. They
can then decide whether they accept the request. The customer can see how many responders are in the area via
the system and which one accepts their request. The customer can then choose from the accepted responders
(e.g. based on ratings, reviews and prices). Once the service is completed, the customer can rate and review it
using the system. Payment will be deducted from their credit card and will be credited to the professional’s
account.
